I bought 10 of these mouse for my office. By observation:Silent buttons and clicks, feels premiumFew of them work perfectly.Some of them developed wired mouse cursor jump and double click issueBattery consumption is too high. Duracell Ultra finished within a month.Back cover is not fixed properly, sometimes gets open while cleaning.

The mice is very small. You can mention it as a baby mouse. It fell down twice from my hand and i had to fix it up. I am ordering a wired mouse again which is bigger in size.Goes to sleep sleep mode when not in useSensor are good.

It's not too good and not too bad, it's just OK at this price point. By the way, the keys are good, it works too good for normal office work, but it's built quality is not so good, but we can ignore it because it's price is also too low, we can't get any Bluetooth mouse at this price, so we can call it a GOOD PRODUCT üëç

Pros:- Saves battery.  Shuts off automatically when not in use for several minutes, or when the PC is shut-down or in hibernation.Cons:- Requires a little more force on the buttons- The external plastic is of cheap quality.  The edges are sharp, and at some places are broken / uneven.- The OFF-ON button is so flimsy and cheap feeling, that it might break after a few uses.  Even cheap toys have better switches.- If the outer quality is such, the quality of internal parts is anyone's guess.  So, the product may not last long.- The user pamphlet is clearly for a 'wireless mouse', but cautions us not to 'bend or kink the cable'.  Which cable, I wonder :-)This, from Amazon!! I am surprised.  Considering the cons, similar or better quality wireless mouse is available in the market for lesser price.

Dislike because the mouse is not smooth to operate. It needs hard touch to activate. The mouse should be like potronics model or Logitech model to work with soft touch (push) .
